<h1> About Me!</h1>

	Here is a little about me. I am a student at <a target="blank"href="https://www.uri.edu"> URI </a> majoring in computer 
engineering <br> and minoring in computer science, <br>

My hobbies are playing soccer and video games.<br> In the picture to the right you can see me standing next to the referee before the start
 of my soccer game. The picture to the left is from graduation, in my cap you can see the flag of both Portugal and Cape verde a small island where
my parents are from.</p>
